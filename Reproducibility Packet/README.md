# Reproducibility Packet

This is the self-contained working packet for the Robot Structural Proprioception project. The current runnable surface reproduces the mechanics feasibility gate; later pipeline stages will be added here as they become final.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- A 64-bit Windows, Linux, or macOS machine supported by the pinned MuJoCo wheel

The feasibility spike is CPU-only and does not require a GPU or an external dataset.

## Step 1 — Create the environment

Creates a local virtual environment and installs the exact dependency versions used for the recorded result.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```

Produces: `.venv/` (local, ignored).

## Step 2 — Run the focused tests

Checks model compilation, independent deformation-state availability, localized stiffness-fault construction, and schema-facing output shapes.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\test_feasibility_spike.py -q
```

Produces: terminal test results.

## Step 3 — Reproduce the mechanics gate

Runs healthy, localized structural-fault, actuator-gain-fault, and encoder-bias scenarios at three mesh/timestep settings; performs an independent cantilever-beam check; probes the reserve volumetric-flex candidate; and writes the gate artifacts.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_feasibility_spike.py --output-dir results\feasibility_spike
```

Produces:

- `results/feasibility_spike/summary.json`
- `results/feasibility_spike/signature_metrics.csv`
- `results/feasibility_spike/feasibility_spike_report.md`
- `results/feasibility_spike/gauge_fault_signatures.png`
- `results/feasibility_spike/feature_signature_heatmap.png`

The command exits with code 0 only when every full-run gate passes. `--quick` is available for a smoke test, but it deliberately does not issue a PASS verdict.

## Step 4 — Reproduce the ordinary-excitation negative control

Repeats the same gate with the distal diagnostic load disabled. This condition is expected to block because its structural and actuator gauge signatures remain below the declared 10 µε credibility floor; exit code 2 is therefore the expected result, not a script failure.

```powershell
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_feasibility_spike.py --diagnostic-tip-load-peak-n 0 --output-dir results\feasibility_spike_ordinary_excitation_blocked
$ordinaryGateExit = $LASTEXITCODE
if ($ordinaryGateExit -ne 2) { throw "Expected BLOCK exit code 2; received $ordinaryGateExit." }
```

Produces the same five artifact types under `results/feasibility_spike_ordinary_excitation_blocked/`.

## Data

No external dataset is required. The simulator generates every value used by the spike. See [`DATA.md`](DATA.md) for the data and licensing boundary.

## Current boundary

This packet reproduces only the mechanics gate. It does not yet implement the full frozen plant→signals→estimator→controller schema, the sensor-realism model, learned attribution, recovery control, confirmatory statistics, or the interactive verification artifact. Those capabilities must not be inferred from this PASS.
